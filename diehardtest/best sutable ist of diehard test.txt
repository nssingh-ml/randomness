But running the entire set is really slow. If it wasn't necessary to run them all or time prohibited that, which of the included tests would be most useful/telling to use?

(It's my understanding that each test approaches this difficult problem with its own strategy â€“ you can't ever know for sure how random something is and the more tests the better. In my case, I'm looking for a good approximation of randomness using a handful of the tests.)
